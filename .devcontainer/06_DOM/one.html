<!-- Difference between innerText and textContent is that inner text will show only the text visible through css property and innerContent will show also the text which is even not visible
and the innerHTML will also give the HTML tag written inside like  "Dom Learning over various Platforms <span style="display: none"> i am going to school</span>"
